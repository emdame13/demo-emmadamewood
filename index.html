        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of different hobbies, so I'll just say a few of them. I like to stay active, 
        so I spend a lot of time running, weightlifting, and hiking. </br> I also love reading. I read 35 books last year. 
        I also love crafting and am getting into scrapbooking the hikes I've done recently.
