        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of different hobbies, so I'll just say a few of them. I like to stay active, 
          so I spend a lot of time running, weightlifting, and hiking. </br> I also love reading. I read 35 books last year. 
          I also love crafting and am getting into scrapbooking the hikes I've done recently.

        <h2>Schoolwork</h2>
        <p>I am in my last year of undergrad degree, and am studying psychology and social computing. 
          I hope to continue my education </br>  after I earn my degree and pursue a master's in school psychology.</p>

        <h2>Family & Friends</h2>
        <p>My immediate family is very small. I have one older brother who is three years older than me. 
          My extended family is pretty big, </br> and our family gatherings are always exciting because of how 
          many people are there. A lot of my friends I have met during my time at college, </br> so when I am on campus
          I spend a lot of time with them.
